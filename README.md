# sincron-brain-model

Plug-and-play memory layer for AI agents. Distributed as an MCP server.

Any project with an AI can plug in and gain structured long-term memory inspired by Obsidian + human brain cognition: Major Tag → Tag → synopsis → content, with cognitive scoring (temporal decay, reactivation, and emotional floors) and nightly sleep-based indexing.

## Status

`0.1.0` — scaffold. Core storage, MCP tools, CLI working. Full LLM-as-judge sleep loop is the next milestone.

## Design principles

- **Major Tag → Tag is the sole retrieval axis.** No vector embeddings. The agent's own reasoning bridges semantic gaps.
- **The agent receives only text.** Multimodal (audio, image, web) is the host app's responsibility — it textualizes, we organize.
- **One API key.** A single LLM provider (the "judge") handles synopsis writing, tag selection, Go Deeper suggestion, merge decisions, and emotional-floor classification at sleep time.
- **Sleep, not eager indexing.** Conversation flows in the host's context window during the day. The sleep cron (default 03:00) processes the draft queue, applies decay, and consolidates memory updates.
- **Feedback, not narrated emotion.** Positive and negative feedback about the AI's answer or memory use can reinforce a memory floor. Emotion inside the narrated fact is stored as content, not as a reinforcement signal.

See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for full architectural decisions.

## Install

Windows / PowerShell one-command install:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MLTCorp/sincron-brain-model/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

The installer is plug-and-play: it installs `uv` for the current user if needed,
then installs the `sincron-brain` CLI from this GitHub repository, updates the
user PATH, and creates a compatibility command shim when the current terminal or
agent has not reloaded PATH yet.

If the repository is private, the raw GitHub URL returns `404`. In that case,
run the checked-out installer directly from this repository:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force; & "C:\Projetos\GitHub-Clones\sincron-brain-model\install.ps1"
```

## Quick start

```powershell
# Inside the project that should use memory:
cd C:\Temp\teste_brain

# Create/use the vault and generate .mcp.json for this project.
sincron-brain connect --path .\memory

# Export the API key for your judge provider (matches the prompt choice)
$env:ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-..."

# (Optional) verify it works
sincron-brain stats

# Force a sleep run on demand
sincron-brain sleep-now
```

`connect` is the recommended plug-and-play path. It creates the vault if needed
and writes a project-level `.mcp.json` like this. For Claude Code projects, it
also syncs `.claude/settings.local.json` so the `sincron-brain` server is enabled
and stale project MCP entries are removed. It also writes a managed memory
instruction block to `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, so agents know when to consult
`use_memories()` and when to save durable facts with `remember()` or full
conversation turns with `remember_turn()`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sincron-brain": {
      "command": "sincron-brain",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "SINCRON_BRAIN_VAULT": "C:\\Temp\\teste_brain\\memory"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Development

On Windows/PowerShell:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m ruff check src tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest
```

If Python was installed through Microsoft Store and `python` is not on PATH yet,
use the Store alias directly:

```powershell
& "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\Microsoft\WindowsApps\python3.13.exe" -m venv .venv
```

## MCP client configuration

The simplest path is to run this inside the project:

```powershell
sincron-brain connect --path .\memory
```

That writes `.mcp.json` for MCP clients that read project-level config. Restart
your MCP client/agent after running it.

If your MCP client does not read `.mcp.json`, copy the generated server block
into that client's MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sincron-brain": {
      "command": "sincron-brain",
      "args": ["serve"],
      "env": {
        "SINCRON_BRAIN_VAULT": "/absolute/path/to/your/memory",
        "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY": "sk-ant-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

After restart, your agent will have access to these tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `remember(content, source_type, asset_ref, hint_tags, metadata)` | Queue content for indexing at next sleep. |
| `remember_turn(user_message, agent_response, memory_reason, hint_tags, metadata)` | Queue both sides of a conversation turn so sleep can compile contextual memory instead of raw transcript. |
| `list_major_tags()` | List all themes in the vault. Entry point for navigation. |
| `list_tags(major_tag, min_score, limit)` | List memory cards (id + synopsis) under a theme. |
| `use_memories(memory_ids, reason)` | Main path to fetch full memory content and queue sleep-time reactivation. |
| `read_memory(memory_id)` | Neutral inspection/debug escape hatch; not the normal answer path. |
| `search(query, limit)` | Full-text fallback when tag navigation isn't enough. |
| `sleep_now()` | Force indexing job to run immediately. |
| `stats()` | Vault diagnostics. |

## Scoring model

Scores stay in a 1-100 range. New memories start at `100`, temporal decay lowers stale memories by `1.5` points per day, and the global floor is `1`.

Emotional reinforcement uses `emotion_floor`, not a score above 100. Feedback or correction about the AI's answer/memory use raises that floor with decreasing impact:

```text
40, +20, +10, +5, +3, +2
max emotion_floor = 80
```

Positive and negative feedback use the same table. For example, "you remembered this perfectly" and "I already told you this, don't ask again" are both priority signals. A sentence like "this client frustrated me by paying late" is stored as memory content, but does not raise the emotional floor by itself.

Exploratory navigation does not reinforce memories: `list_major_tags()`, `list_tags()`, and `search()` return tags/synopses only. When full content is needed to answer the user, the agent calls `use_memories()`. That returns the memory bodies and queues a reactivation event; the next sleep consolidates drafts first, applies decay, then sets those memories back to `100`.

`read_memory()` remains available as a neutral inspection/debug escape hatch for MCP clients that need it, but the plug-and-play answer flow is intentionally:

```text
list/search synopses -> use_memories(ids) -> answer
```

## Audit log

Each vault keeps a local JSONL audit log at:

```text
memory/_audit.jsonl
```

It records tool usage and sleep decisions such as `tool.search`, `tool.use_memories`,
`sleep.draft_processed`, `sleep.memory_decayed`, and `sleep.memory_reactivated`.
The log is meant for debugging and user trust: it stores IDs, counts, scores,
timestamps, and short reasons, but redacts full content and common sensitive
fields such as API keys, tokens, passwords, and secrets.

Audit is enabled by default with bounded retention:

```toml
[audit]
enabled = true
retention_days = 90
max_file_mb = 25
```

## Vault structure

```
memory/
├── _config.toml            ← provider, schedule, score tuning
├── _index.sqlite           ← rebuildable index (scores, FTS, metadata)
├── _audit.jsonl            ← local audit trail, no full memory content
├── _draft/                 ← queue waiting for next sleep
│   └── 20260513-143200-xyz.json
├── _reactivation/          ← memories used in final answer context
│   └── 20260513-151000-reactivation.json
├── pessoas/
│   ├── mateus-massari-abc12345.md
│   └── luizao-def67890.md
└── trabalho/
    └── reuniao-cliente-acme.md
```

Each `.md` is a memory card with YAML frontmatter (id, major_tags, score, synopsis, etc.) + body. Readable directly in Obsidian.

## Supported judge providers

OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Voyage, Cohere, Mistral, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama (local), custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Routed via [litellm](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) — adding a new one means one config entry.

## Why no embeddings

The agent's own LLM reasoning is smarter than vector similarity for navigation. Major Tag → Tag bypasses the embedding tax entirely. See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full rationale.
